# Welcome to Microblog!

This is an example application featured in my [Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world). See the tutorial for instructions on how to work with it.

## Development Cycle:
1. Create an appropriate [issue](https://github.com/JoshuaPicchioni/microblog/issues) on github.
1. Create a branch from the issue (look at the side bar).
1. Checkout the branch on your local git
1. Make the changes (document and test them too)
1. Commit changes and push your branch to github
1. Create a PR request (using the template)
1. Ask others in the group for a PR review (send them the link)
1. Enjoy!
